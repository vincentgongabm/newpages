A pair of primers flanking each sgRNA target site is required to detect genomic cleavage using the kit, and this can be ordered from abm (Cat. No. C336 - <a href=\"/Primer-Design-Primer-Synthesis.html\">sgRNA PCR Primer Pair Design & Synthesis Service</a>). The products are then denatured and re-annealed to produce mismatches within the double strand. Our detection enzyme is able to recognize such mismatches and cleaves the strands to produce band sizes that are easily distinguishable upon gel analysis. The ready-to-use CRISPR Genomic Cleavage Detection Kit conveniently contains all the necessary reagents required, including a set of control template and primers to ensure reliable results. The control template has an approximate size of 750bp after PCR amplification and of 500bp and 250bp after the enzymatic cleavage.
