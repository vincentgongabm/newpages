			<p>Conventional mammalian expression systems rely on the usage of strong viral promoters (e.g. CMV and SV40) which in turn over-express the gene of interest (GOI). However, over-expression of a foreign gene can lead to detrimental effects in the cell and importantly, fails to replicate normal physiological gene expression levels. To address this issue, miR-Tuners can be used to precisely fine-tune transgene expression levels in a predictable manner. <br /><br /> miR-Tuners are short, synthetic miRNA response element sequences which reside in the 3â€™ UTR of the GOI. These sequences are responsive to a native miRNA species which is widely expressed in many human and mouse cells. Using the miR-Tuner Low, Med or Hi will allow for precise low, medium or high expression levels of the GOI, respectively. <br /><br /> <strong>abm</strong> offers a variety of miR-Tuner products which can precisely and predictably control transgene expression levels in mammalian cells. These products include ready-to-clone miR-Tuner MCS (multiple cloning site) Lentiviral Vectors and custom cloning services of your GOI into a set of miR-Tuner Vectors and/or Lentiviral packaging.</p>
