						<strong>Using CRISPR to develop a biallelic LIF knockout in Mouse Colon Carcinoma Cells</strong>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>LIF locus in a Mouse Colon Carcinoma Cell Line, was knocked out using CRISPR targeted genome editing.</li>
							<li>Surveyor assay and sequencing results showed genome editing.</li>
							<li>After monoclonal selection biallelic knockout was confirmed by sequencing.</li>
							<li><strong>abm</strong> will generate the desired stable cell line and perform QC.</li>
						</ul>
						<br /> <strong>Phase #1: Cas9 and sgRNA Delivery</strong>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>Three sgRNA were designed against mouse LIF locus (Mus musculus, NM_008501). Software analysis was performed to ensure the sgRNA had no predicted off targets binding sites. The selected sgRNA design was then cloned into the pLenti-U6-sgRNA-SFFV-Cas9-2A-Puro All-in-One lentivector (Figure 1).</li>
							<li>Recombinant Lentiviruses were packaged using abm’s second generation Lentiviral packaging system. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 was used to transduce the cells.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<div>
							<p class="banners abm-category-workflow"><a href="javascript:void(0)"><img src="/pub/media/catalog/customservice/crispr-stable-knockout-cell-line/pLenti-U6-sgRNA-SFFV-Cas9-2A-Puro-NEW.png" alt="Workflow" /></a></p>
						</div>
						<i>Figure 1. pLenti-U6-sgRNA-SFFV-Cas9-2A-Puro lentivector is an all-in-one vector for co-expressing sgRNA and Cas9 in mammalian cells. Expression of sgRNA is driven by the U6 promoter, a strong constitutive Pol III promoter. An SFFV promoter drives expression of the Cas9-2A-Puro cassette. By using the Cas9-2A-Puro cassette, cells can be directly screened for expression of Cas9, as they will be resistant to Puromycin.</i><br /><br /> <strong>Phase #2: First Round of Colony Screening for Edited Clones</strong>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>Cell colonies are isolated after puromycin selection. Genomic DNA was extracted and the surveyor assay was performed to confirm genomic editing of the LIF locus.</li>
							<li>A single band in a surveyor assay at the wild-type (WT) size indicates no editing has occurred; two smaller bands (that sum to the length of the WT) indicate editing has taken place.</li>
							<li>The surveyor assay (Figure 2) indicated that Colony 3 and 6 were edited; colony 2 was not edited; and colony 1 was inconclusive.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<div>
							<p class="banners abm-category-workflow"><a href="javascript:void(0)"><img src="/pub/media/catalog/customservice/crispr-stable-knockout-cell-line/Surveyor.png" alt="Workflow" /></a></p>
						</div>
						<i>Figure 2. The surveyor assay indicated that Colony 3 and 6 were edited; colony 2 was not edited; and colony 1 was inconclusive.</i><br /><br /> <strong>Phase #3: Sequence Analysis of the Edited Colonies</strong>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>PCR products from Colonies 3 and 6 were further analyzed via Sanger Sequencing to determine the nature of the knockout (Figure 3).</li>
							<li>For colony 3 only one mutant sequence was detected, indicating that these cells are likely only heterozyotic knockouts. In colony 6 two different mutant sequences were detected.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<div>

						</div>
						<i>Figure 3. For colony 3 only one mutant sequence was detected, indicating that these cells are likely only heterozyotic knockouts. In colony 6 two different mutant sequences were detected.</i><br /><br /> <strong>Phase #4: Second Round of Selection for Monoclonal Biallelic Knockout Clones</strong>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>Colony 6 was serial diluted into 96 well plates for monoclonal selection. Genomic DNA was extracted from these clones (i.e. 6a, 6b..), PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced.</li>
							<li>Of the colony 6 clones, sequencing showed that only clone 6a had a frameshift mutation in both alleles (Figure 4). A frameshift mutation disrupts the open reading frame, resulting in nonsense mediated decay of mRNA transcript.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />

						</div>
						<i>Figure 4. Clones 6a, 6b and 6d all showed biallelic editing. Only clone 6a had frame shift mutations in both alleles. No WT sequences were detected in all subclones.</i><br />
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>Further sequencing of clone 6a confirmed that only two mutant alleles were present, the 2 bp and 4 bp deletions, and that no WT or other mutations were detected (Figure 5).</li>
						</ul>
						<div>
							<p class="banners abm-category-workflow"><a href="javascript:void(0)"><img src="/pub/media/catalog/customservice/crispr-stable-knockout-cell-line/Sequence-Alignment 3.png" alt="Workflow" /></a></p>
						</div>
						<i>Figure 5. Further sequencing of 6a confirmed biallelic knock-out. No WT sequences were detected.</i><br /><br /> <strong>Phase #5: Confirmation of Knockout by Next Generation Amplicon Sequencing</strong>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 0px;">
							<li>With next generation sequencing hundreds of thousands of alleles can be sequenced at once, resulting in a more robust dataset. By contrast Sanger sequencing is only feasible for 1-100 clones and therefore it can miss a large proportion of the population.</li>
							<li>Next generation sequencing was performed at each stage of selection to evaluate knockout (Figure 6). Before editing, only WT sequences were observed. After the first round of selection colony 6 showed a mixture of edited (70%) and WT (30%) sequences. Finally after monoclonal selection, clone 6a showed only edited sequences with no WT alleles present.</li>
						</ul>

						<i>Figure 6. Next Generation Sequencing for CRISPR Knockout screening. A) Before knockout only WT sequences are detected. B) After Cas9 and sgRNA delivery, the first round of selection shows a mixed distribution of indel and WT sequences. C) After the second round of selection only knockouts remain.</i>

An alternative method is to send us two T25 flask of live cells per sample, at 90% confluency. The flasks should be filled with complete medium without any air bubbles and at room temperature. Please ensure that the sterilization procedure is strictly observed. To avoid delays over the weekend, we recommend shipping the cells on a Monday or a Tuesday. Frozen cells are preferred over live cells. If your cell line already contains an antibiotic resistance marker, please specify. Our vectors have puromycin resistance by default. If your cells require medium other than DMEM and RPMI, we will also require 1L of the specified medium and any applicable growth factors or supplements to be provided by you for the project. Please submit all components of the complete media (e.g. if growth factors, cytokines etc. are applicable) individually to eliminate potential degradation of components in the media during transit. Kindly include instructions for making the complete media in your shipment. Additionally, please provide at least 5 x coated 6-well plates and 10 x T25 flasks if the cells require specially treated culture vessels. Once you have shipped your cells, please forward us the tracking number for custom clearance. Information on how to ship cell samples to abm can be found on our support page: https://www.abmgood.com/Technical-Support.html Please place an order first prior to submitting your samples.

Off-target analysis: This will need to be done by NGS, whole genome sequencing or exome sequencing, which would require comparing the control (before) sample to the genome edited sample (after). If this is a desired option, we can provide a quote for it, but it will likely be at least $2200 for analyzing 1-2 clones by Exome Seq, and higher for whole genome sequencing.</div>

For even greater certainty, we also offer Next Generation Sequencing confirmation (AI00100), which can detect WT alleles down to 10% of total. Being much more sensitive, NGS screening is ideal for detecting complete editing of multiple copy genes, or polyploid cell lines.</div>
